Ingredients

Almond Flour – Provides structure, flavor and texture to the macarons. I prefer using Bob’s Red Mill super fine almond flour or you can make your own.
Powdered Sugar – Gives the cookie a little bit of sweetness 
Cocoa Powder – Can’t have chocolate macarons without chocolate!
Aged Egg Whites – Provides structure and texture that is iconic to the French Macaron
Vanilla Extract – Enhances the flavor of the macaron. You can use other flavors too!
Granulated Sugar – Helps the egg whites whip up properly
Salt – Enhances the flavor of the chocolate
