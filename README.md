Macarons

A Macaron Is Small Round Cake With A Meringue-Like Consistency. The Contrast Of Textures And Tastes Constantly Surprises.

Ingredients

Almond Flour, Powdered Sugar, Cocoa Powder, Aged Egg Whites, Vanilla Extract, Granulated Sugar, Salt.

Method

1. Sift together the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, salt and almond meal. This is important so you can remove any hard lumps that might be in the mixture which will ruin the shiny surface of your cookie later.
2. Place the almond flour mixture into a food processor and pulse 8-10 times to make the mixture finer in texture and to get it mixed together really well.
3. Whip your egg whites until frothy with the whisk attachment then slowly add in your granulated sugar while mixing on low.
4. Continue mixing until the egg whites become white and you can see some lines being made in the meringue. Add in your cream of tartar.
5. Whip until soft glossy peaks form. Now add in your extract and food coloring if you are coloring your macarons.
6. Continue whipping on medium-high until the meringue is at stiff peaks. The meringue will feel dense and will start gathering on the inside of the whisk.
7. Add in 1/3 of your almond mixture and fold by taking your spatula and going around the edge of the bowl just under the batter, then cut through the center. Repeat this until you don’t see any dry spots.
8. Add in the rest of your dry ingredients and continue folding.
9. Place your spatula flat on top of the batter and turn the bowl to knock out some of the air from the batter. You want the batter to fall from the spatula like a ribbon and move similar to lava. 
10. Once your batter falls from the spatula in a ribbon, try and draw a figure 8. If the batter doesn’t break, it’s ready. You will also notice the edges of the batter begin to turn glossy and the mixture oozes very slowly. The ribbon should dissolve back into the batter after about 20 seconds.
11. Place the piping bag into a cup while you pour in the batter. The cup helps hold up the bag so you can scoop every last drop of that batter into the bag.
12. Now you can pipe your macarons onto your parchment paper and bake! I use a #802 round piping tip and a template. Hold your tip straight up in the center of the circle, about 1/4″ away from the paper and squeeze until the batter fills the circle 3/4 of the way then lift straight up quickly to break the batter off.
13. Lift your tray up about 5 inches and drop onto the table to pop any bubbles that are under the surface of your macaron and the batter should spread to the edge of the circle.
14. Let your macaron sit at room temperature until a crust forms over the surface. Depending on your room, it can take from 30 minutes to 2 hours. You should be able to touch the top lightly and it doesn’t feel sticky.
